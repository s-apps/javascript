# Combine an array into a string using the join method

The join method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.

Here's an example:

```sh
var arr = ["Hello", "World"];
var str = arr.join(" ");
```

str would have a value of the string Hello World.
