# Set the child's prototype to an instance of the parent

In the previous challenge you saw the first step for inheriting behavior from the supertype (or parent) Animal: making a new instance of Animal.

This challenge covers the next step: set the prototype of the subtype (or child)—in this case, Bird—to be an instance of Animal.

```sh
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
```

Remember that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. In a way, the recipe for Bird now includes all the key "ingredients" from Animal.

```sh
let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck.eat();
```

duck inherits all of Animal's properties, including the eat method.
