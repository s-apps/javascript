# Use dor notation to access the properties of an object

The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

```sh
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
```
Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of Aflac.
